# Archaeological Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio for Archaeological Data Ananlysis! This contains various projects worked on throughout the semester.


**Roman Coins**

In this project, the class investigated a Roman coin hoard. Using the Jupyter Notebook, we were able to analyze different aspects of the coins such as find spot, production area, value, and rulers. 

**Greek Vases Map**

This project entailed locating various works of Greek pottery on a map. The map showed the locations of the Greek vases along with data about the vases such as type and painter.

**Ptolemy Map**

This project sought to create a rescaled map of Ptolemy's data regarding geogrpahic coordinates in the ancient world. Through analysis of coordinates and actual geographical values and points in contemporary proven geography, we were able to adjust Ptolemy's data to roughly render a map depicting where his coordinates would be given that he had the same Earth scale and values used today.
